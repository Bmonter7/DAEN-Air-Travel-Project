Air Travel: Pre-Pandemic vs Post-Pandemic 
The objective of our data analysis project is to show how the air travel industry as a whole was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which brought the world to a halt in the middle of March 2020. 
We will take a look at how many passengers were still flying, how many passenger flights were still in the air, how many cargo flights were still in the air, and how each airline was impacted alone. 
Through different data visualization and data analysis techniques, we will model and display the data to show that the air travel industry was negatively impacted during March 2020.
